# Comparative Analysis of Deep Learning models for detecting Fake News #

Fake news is invalid and misleading information that is conveyed as accurate news. Fake news detection has become indispensable in modern society because of the extreme propagation of false news on social platforms and news portals. Several studies have been released that use fake news on social platforms instead of news content for decision-making.

## Highlights:
- Did a comparative analysis of models and vectorizers for detecting fake news
- Implemented vectorizers – TF IDF and GloVe, and trained models – RNN and LSTM
- Compared the performance of each combination of vectorizer + model
- Libraries used: Natural Language Toolkit and TensorFlow
